# Grade-Course App Documentation

## Overview
The `grade_course` app manages the many-to-many relationship between grades and courses in the Mini University system. It defines which courses are available for specific grades.

## Features
- âœ… Create grade-course relationships
- âœ… List all grade-course relationships with filtering
- âœ… Get courses by grade
- âœ… Get grades by course
- âœ… Bulk assign courses to grades
- âœ… Summary view of relationships
- âœ… Full CRUD operations
- âœ… Admin interface integration
- âœ… Comprehensive API documentation

## Model Structure

### GradeCourse Model
```python
class GradeCourse(models.Model):
    grade = models.ForeignKey(Grade, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='grade_courses')
    course = models.ForeignKey(Course, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='grade_courses')
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
```

**Constraints:**
- Unique together: `(grade, course)` - prevents duplicate relationships
- Cascade delete: When a grade or course is deleted, related relationships are also deleted

## API Endpoints

      "grade_course_id": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 5. Summary View
- **GET** `/api/grade-courses/summary/`
- Returns simplified list of all relationships

#### 6. Bulk Assignment
- **POST** `/api/grade-courses/bulk-assign/`
- Assign multiple courses to a grade at once

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "grade_id": 1,
  "courses": [
    {"course_id": 1},
    {"course_id": 2},
    {"course_id": 3}
  ]
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "created": [...],
  "created_count": 3,
  "errors": []
}
```

## Serializers

### GradeCourseSerializer
Full serializer with related data and enrollment counts.

### GradeCourseCreateUpdateSerializer
Simplified serializer for create/update operations with validation.

### GradeCourseSummarySerializer
Minimal serializer for summary views.

### CoursesByGradeSerializer
Shows all courses for a specific grade.

### GradesByCourseSerializer
Shows all grades for a specific course.

## Usage Examples

### 1. Create a Grade-Course Relationship
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/grade-courses/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"grade": 1, "course": 1}'
```

### 2. Get All Courses for Grade 1
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/grade-courses/grade/1/courses/
```

### 3. Get All Grades for Mathematics Course
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/grade-courses/course/1/grades/
```

### 4. Bulk Assign Courses to a Grade
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/grade-courses/bulk-assign/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "grade_id": 1,
    "courses": [
      {"course_id": 1},
      {"course_id": 2}
    ]
  }'
```

### 5. Search Relationships
```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/grade-courses/?search=mathematics"
```

## Admin Interface

The admin interface provides:
- List view with grade, course, and enrollment counts
- Filtering by grade, course, and creation date
- Search functionality across grade and course names
- Inline editing capabilities
- Optimized queries with select_related

## Validation Rules

1. **Unique Constraint**: Each grade-course combination can only exist once
2. **Foreign Key Validation**: Grade and course must exist
3. **Cascade Delete**: Relationships are deleted when parent objects are deleted

## Integration with Other Apps

### Enrollments Integration
The grade_course relationships work with the enrollments system:
- Students can only enroll in courses assigned to their grade
- Enrollment counts are calculated per grade-course relationship

### Usage in Views
```python
# Get courses available for a student's grade
student_grade = student.grade
available_courses = Course.objects.filter(
    grade_courses__grade=student_grade
)
```

## Testing

### Run Unit Tests
```bash
python manage.py test grade_course
```

### Run API Tests
```bash
python test_grade_course_api.py
```

## Files Structure

```
grade_course/
â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”œâ”€â”€ admin.py          # Admin configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ apps.py           # App configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ models.py         # GradeCourse model
â”œâ”€â”€ serializers.py    # DRF serializers
â”œâ”€â”€ tests.py          # Unit tests
â”œâ”€â”€ urls.py           # URL routing
â”œâ”€â”€ views.py          # API views
â””â”€â”€ migrations/       # Database migrations
```

## Performance Considerations

1. **Query Optimization**: Uses `select_related()` for foreign key fields
2. **Pagination**: Built-in pagination for large datasets
3. **Indexing**: Unique constraint creates database index
4. **Bulk Operations**: Efficient bulk assignment endpoint

## Future Enhancements

Potential features that could be added:
- Course prerequisites based on grade progression
- Academic year/semester constraints
- Course capacity management per grade
- Advanced reporting and analytics

The grade_course app provides a solid foundation for managing the curriculum structure in the Mini University system! ðŸŽ“
